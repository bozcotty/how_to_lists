# Multiple How-To Lists

## Description

We were tasked with creating an app that allows visitors to create How-To Lists. They needed to be able to CRUD the lists, as well as the steps within each list.

Having been doing BDD for the past few weeks, I decided I wanted to see what it was like to create this app sans tests. I deliberately wanted to compare the experience of 'testlessness' vs. BDD when building an app from scratch. More specifically, I wanted to see if the flow through error messages was more intuitive via the BDD way or the way of just building the thing I thought the app needed next.

Now that the app is functional, I still find myself wondering if all my links work, even though I think I've manually tested them all. In retrospect, even though this was a fairly straightforward exercise in creating nested resources, I think I actually would have saved time and bother by creating my tests first. Lesson learned!
